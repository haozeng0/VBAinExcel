# Ulrich’s Web API &amp; Elsevier Scopus API in Excel

ENUG 2017 Presentation

Using Excel and VBA with APIs to Wow Your Colleagues and Patrons, presented by Hao Zeng – Yeshiva University, Annamarie Klose Hrubes - William Paterson University

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a powerful way for libraries to gather data, including usage statistics, bibliographic information, and metrics. In the context of an academic library, the presenters will describe their workflow for pulling data from APIs into Excel with Visual Basic Applications (VBA). Using two examples , they will explain how and why this method provides a user-friendly solution that empowers other departments, inside and outside the library, to gather data independently. They will demonstrate their use of Scopus and Ulrich’s Web APIs.
